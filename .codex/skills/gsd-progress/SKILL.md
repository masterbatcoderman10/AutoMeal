## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-progress`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-progress` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, activate TEXT_MODE: append `--text` to `{{GSD_ARGS}}` so the workflow's built-in text-mode branching takes over. Present every `AskUserQuestion` call as a plain-text numbered list, then stop and wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018 / #3808).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → Codex Multi-Agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex multi-agent tools when they are actually available.

Tool discovery first:
- Before deciding sub-agents are unavailable, call `tool_search` with a query like `spawn agent multi-agent subagent wait close agent`.
- If discovery exposes `multi_agent_v1`, use `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent`, `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent`, and `multi_agent_v1.close_agent`.
- Do not claim multi-agent spawning is unavailable just because it was not in the initial tool list; Codex may expose the tools lazily after discovery.

Direct mapping after discovery:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit by default. GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml` at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router. Only pass a model override when the user explicitly requested it or the runtime contract requires it.
- Resolved `reasoning_effort="low|medium|high|xhigh"` → pass `reasoning_effort` only when the exposed tool schema supports it. Omit missing, empty, inherited, or unsupported values; do not invent one-off effort literals in workflow prose.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
- `Task(isolation="worktree")` / `Agent(isolation="worktree")` → no automatic Codex worktree binding. Workflows that require worktree isolation must use an explicit manual worktree protocol before spawning (#3360).

Spawn restriction and fallback:
- Codex permits sub-agent spawning only when the user explicitly asks for sub-agents, delegation, or parallel agent work, or when the invoked GSD workflow itself explicitly requires sub-agents as part of the user's chosen command.
- If `tool_search` does not expose multi-agent tools, or spawning is not permitted, do not stop at a tooling complaint. Execute the workflow inline in the current agent where safe, preserving gates and artifacts; if the workflow explicitly requires isolated sub-agents/worktrees and no safe inline path exists, fail closed with the exact missing capability and next remediation.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent(targets=[...])` as needed.

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `multi_agent_v1.close_agent(target=id)` after collecting results from each agent.

<objective>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action.

Three modes:
- **default**: Show progress report + intelligently route to the next action (execute or plan). Provides situational awareness before continuing work.
- **--next**: Automatically advance to the next logical step without manual route selection. Reads STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, and phase directories. Supports `--force` to bypass safety gates.
- **--do "task description"**: Analyze freeform natural language and dispatch to the most appropriate GSD command. Never does the work itself — matches intent, confirms, hands off.
- **--forensic**: Append a 6-check integrity audit after the standard progress report.
</objective>

<flags>
- **--next**: Detect current project state and automatically invoke the next logical GSD workflow step. Scans all prior phases for incomplete work before routing. `--next --force` bypasses safety gates.
- **--next --auto**: Like `--next`, but after the determined step completes, automatically re-invokes `$gsd-progress --next --auto` to continue chaining steps until completion or a blocking decision. Enables hands-free plan→execute→verify→complete progression.
- **--do "..."**: Smart dispatcher — match freeform intent to the best GSD command using routing rules, confirm the match, then hand off.
- **--forensic**: Run 6-check integrity audit after the standard progress report.
- **(no flag)**: Standard progress check + intelligent routing (Routes A through F).

Arguments provided: "{{GSD_ARGS}}"
Parse the first token from the provided arguments:
- If it is `--next`: strip the flag, execute the next workflow (passing remaining args e.g. --force, --auto).
- If it is `--do`: strip the flag, pass remainder as freeform intent to the do workflow.
- Otherwise: execute the progress workflow end-to-end (pass --forensic through if present).

Preserve all routing logic from the target workflow.
